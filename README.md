# Jeff's CircleCI Technical

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To get started:
Run `npm install` to create the node_modules
Run `npm start` to boot into your localhost:3000
Run `npm build` to create a more recent production version
Run `npm test` to view the test suites
Run `npm test:ci` to output a junit.xml file with data regarding the tests

Alternatively, replace npm with the approriate yarn commands to get started as well

## The App

The App itself is a calculator with basic functions:

- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Additional features like decimals, percentage changes, and change signs are also supported
- Supports the operation on up to two numbers

Note: The calculator must be cleared using the "C" button for any new operations e.g after performing a calclation or if you want to reset the a previous entry
